<!-- Hey! we finally learned how to comment in html. Anyways, this is the login
page template. It's cool that we can extend a base html from another app like
learning_logs. Fortunately, we don't have to create a form or view function
since Django will use its default login view (remember LoginView from urls.py?)
The form has an errors attribute which we use for a conditional that displays
an error message. We want the login view to process the form, so we set the
action argument as the URL of the login page. The login view sends a form to
the template, and it's up to us to dsplay the form and add a submit button.
Since we can't redirect from the view function (cuz we didn't make one), we 
can redirect in the template file where we put a hidden form element, 'next'.
The value argument of this input tells Django to redirect the user after they've
logged in successfully. -->
